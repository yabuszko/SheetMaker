# SheetMaker
A C++/OpenCV code file which turns a number of images into one image sheet. 

## Preliminaries
Install OpenCV
Make sure that all images have identical dimensions and that all are named according to the following pattern: "[basename][index]", e.g. "image1", "image2" etc. Place them in the same depository as main.cpp

## Usage
Enter the base name, number of images and whether you'd like the sheet to be horizontal or vertical.
